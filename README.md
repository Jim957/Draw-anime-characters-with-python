# Draw-anime-characters-with-python
You can download almost all the cartoon characters painted with python here, 
but please remember that python 3.9 or more must be installed on your computer.

You can right-click on the file with the py suffix and then click Edit to see the source code inside, 
and you can change it as you like,
because it's open source.
